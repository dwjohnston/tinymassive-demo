# Tiny Massive Submission - Biker on the waves. 

**IMPORTANT** You must use node 9.11 to run this application. 

You can use nvm to easily switch between node versions. 

## To Run: 

```
node index.js
```

By default it runs on port 3000, but you can change that with the `port` environment variable. 

## For your hosting purposes: 

 - The canvas is is the top right corner as requested
 - Just open the site in the browser - and keep the 'random every 30 seconds' button clicked. 
 - If noone else is using the applicaiton you will stay on the queue and the image will change every 30 seconds. 

 ## You don't have to host it

 - If you want you can just point people to my deployment, which is publically available
 - https://tinymassive.herokuapp.com/
 - And if you are on the website, you can access the tiny canvas


 ## How it works

 - It's using websockets and a queing system to recieve and broadcast updates, everytime the active user makes a change.
